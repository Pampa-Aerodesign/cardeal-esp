# Cardeal ESP

This is the repository for Pampa Aerodesign's first continuously developed embedded system, cardeal-esp.

## Cloning the repo

This repo contains some git submodules, so you need extra steps when cloning the repo to local:

1. git clone https://github.com/Pampa-Aerodesign/cardeal-esp.git
2. git submodule init
3. git submodule update

Git submodules are basically repositories embedded inside another repository. In our case, some ESP components from the GitHub community are referenced this way.
